To view the graph click on index.html and open it on any browser.
If you are on visual studio code editor or sublime text editor then simple right click on index.html and click on "copy path" and paste it on browser.

I used the json_data here to create graph. The structure of data in index.js file is what we need to construct using d3.js.

I need to create nodes of graph using "id" of data as you can see in data.json file.
The task is that I have to create node of graph only when the value of node is true
as you can see in object ( "pillar1_risk":true, "pillar2_risk":false,) in data.json file. If pillar1_risk : true,only then pillar1_risk get created otherwise not.

Structure of data I need to follow is already in index.js file's data. And the static graph you can see in the screenshot with this folder, I need to create exactly graph but with the help of true/false values. Because this data is coming from an API Response, so we have to structure the data according to our need.

If you don't understand anything or you want to tell me something, then please contact me.

I really need your help because I'm new to this and just don't understand it. Please help me. I'll be very grateful.

Thank you
Anisha
